Where Linked Lists are used in real life:

1.Music/Video Playlists
– Next/previous songs are linked like nodes.

2.Undo/Redo (CTRL+Z / CTRL+Y)
– Each action is a node linked to previous/next action.

3.Browser Forward/Back History
– Each visited page is a node linked in sequence.

4.Scheduling (OS Task Management)
– Processes in OS are kept in linked structures.

5.Memory Management / Allocators
– Free blocks of memory stored as linked lists.

6.Navigation in apps (Breadcrumbs)
– Steps/screens linked in order.

7.Implementing Queues/Stacks
– Many internal libraries use linked lists.

8.File systems (FAT)
– File blocks are stored as linked nodes.



👉 WHY LINKED LISTS ARE USED RATHER THAT ARRAYS:
In a list (array):
Elements are stored continuously in memory.
So if you remove or insert something in the middle or at the start, all the elements after it must shift one position.
This shifting takes time (O(n)).

In a linked list:
Each element stores only two things: data + address of next.
To insert or delete, you just change a couple of pointers.
No shifting.
This takes constant time (O(1)).

That’s why modifying is faster in linked list.
